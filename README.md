# Calorie Burn Prediction using Machine Learning 🏃‍♂️🔥

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burned during physical activity based on attributes like gender, age, height, weight, duration, and heart rate.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Accurately estimating the calories burned during physical activities can help users track fitness goals and maintain a healthy lifestyle. This project explores regression-based techniques to solve this problem.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Gender
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Duration (exercise time)
- Heart Rate
- Body Temperature

Target Variable:
- Calories Burned

## 📌 Features & Workflow

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling
- Model Building (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluation using R² score and Mean Squared Error
- Visualizations of predictions vs actual values
- Hyperparameter tuning

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results

- Best model: Random Forest Regressor
- Achieved R² score: ~0.94 on test set
- Visualization: Predicted vs Actual Calories plot
